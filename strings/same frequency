question:The program must accept a string S as the input. 
          The program must print YES if all the alphabets in the string S have the same frequency. 
          Else the program must print NO as the output. 
          Note: String S contains only lower-case alphabets. 
          Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= Length of String <= 1000 
          Input Format: The first line contains the string S. 
          Output Format: The first line contains either YES or NO.
          Example Input/Output 1: Input: venom
          Output: YES 
          Explanation: The frequency for the alphabet 'v' is 1 The frequency for the alphabet 'e' is 1 The frequency for the alphabet 'n' is 1 The frequency for the alphabet 'o' is 1 The frequency for the alphabet 'm' is 1 Here all the alphabets have the same frequency 1 Hence the output YES is printed. 
          Example Input/Output 2: Input: better 
          Output: NO 
          Explanation: The frequency for the alphabet 'b' is 1 The frequency for the alphabet 'e' is 2 The frequency for the alphabet 't' is 2 The frequency for the alphabet 'r' is 1 Here the alphabets 'b' and 'r' have the frequency 1, but the alphabets 'e' and 't' have the frequency 2 Hence the output NO is printed.
solution in c:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char str[1001]; // Buffer to hold the input string (max 1000 characters + null terminator)
    scanf("%s", str); // Read the input string

    int alphaCount[26] = {0}; // Array to count occurrences of each character (for 'a' to 'z')
    int count; // This will hold the frequency of the first character

    // Count frequencies of each character in the string
    for (int index = 0; str[index] != '\0'; index++) {
        alphaCount[str[index] - 'a']++; // Increment the count for the corresponding character
    }

    // Store the frequency of the first character
    count = alphaCount[str[0] - 'a'];

    // Check if all characters have the same frequency
    for (int index = 0; index < 26; index++) {
        if (alphaCount[index] > 0 && count != alphaCount[index]) {
            printf("NO\n"); // If any character's frequency differs from the first, print "NO"
            return 0; // Exit the program
        }
    }

    printf("YES\n"); // If all frequencies are the same, print "YES"
    return 0;
}
